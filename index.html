      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hello! My name is Thom! I am new to the world of coding. I've been teaching myself basic front-end development for the past 2 months and finally decided to sign up for a bootcamp. 
        I am learning how to code to change my career path. I currently work for an Environmental Consultanting Firm as an Industrial Hygienist and while the work can be interesting, its often very dangerous and underpaid. 
        I'm looking forward to learning a lot of new things and working together with everyone else!
      </p>
